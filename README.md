# mIRC-Sounds
mIRC Chat sounds effects with sox

The sound commands were taken from an IRSSI script and
put into a shell script. Make sure to correct the paths
in remote.ini file. Works with WSL and Cygwin. run64.exe
is only needed for WSL, since this lets 320bit apps execute
files in the 64-bit system directory.
